# Telemetrix4Esp32

This repository contains both WI-FI and BLE servers that permit you to monitor
and control an ESP32 device using standard Python 3 scripts running on a PC.

Both super-loop and FreeRTOS versions are included. Functionality for super-loop and 
FreeRTOS versions are currently identical, however the FreeRTOS versions are under 
construction

Because the servers were written using the Arduino ESP32 Core library, installation is 
managed via the Arduino IDE and Library Manager.

A [User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix-esp32/) explaining installation 
and use is available online.
