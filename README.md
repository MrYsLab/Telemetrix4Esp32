# Telemetrix4Esp32

## IMPORTANT NOTE
**The current version of the [OneWire Arduino library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire) - see [Issue #112.](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire/issues/112)
is not compatible with version 2.0.3 of the Espressif arduino-esp32 library.**

**Until this issue is resolved, please use version 2.0.2 of the library.**

This repository contains both WI-FI and BLE servers that permit you to monitor
and control an ESP32 device using standard Python 3 scripts running on a PC.

Because the servers were written using the Arduino ESP32 Core library, installation is 
managed via the Arduino IDE and Library Manager.

A [User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix-esp32/) explaining installation 
and use is available online.
